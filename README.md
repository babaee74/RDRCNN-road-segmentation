# TensorFlow 2 Implementation of Road Segmentation in Radar Images

This repository contains a TensorFlow 2 implementation of the paper titled "A new road extraction method using Sentinel-1 SAR images based on the deep fully convolutional neural network" published in [MDPI] ([DOI: 10.1080/22797254.2019.1694447](https://doi.org/10.1080/22797254.2019.1694447)). The implementation is tailored specifically for our custom dataset, which is available at [https://github.com/babaee74/radar-road-segmenation-dataset](https://github.com/babaee74/radar-road-segmenation-dataset).

## Dataset

The [Radar Road Segmentation Dataset](https://github.com/babaee74/radar-road-segmenation-dataset) is an extensive collection of radar images from eight different cities. The dataset has been meticulously prepared for road segmentation tasks using deep learning techniques. It consists of over 900 high-resolution RGB images, each sized at 256x256 pixels, accompanied by meticulously labeled road masks.

## Implementation

Our TensorFlow 2 implementation provides a framework for training and evaluating road segmentation models using the Radar Road Segmentation Dataset. The implementation leverages deep learning techniques and convolutional neural network architectures to accurately segment roads in radar images.

## Usage
